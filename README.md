# Eyes

# Project Title: "Eye Exercise"

## Description: Events happen to most elements on the DOM. These events are a good way to bind a code to user actions. For example, consider a web page that has a form with a "Submit" button. You can bind the mouse button click to that button and submit the form data upon that click. Therefore, the mouse movement event is used to update the position of the "eye" element displayed on the page. You can walk through the code to see how this all works.


## How to Run: You should run this by copying all the files in this repo and test it by yourself.
